Maven plugin for JAX-WS RI.  Fork of http://jax-ws-commons.java.net/jaxws-maven-plugin/

This may be removed in the future when https://github.com/javaee/metro-jaxws-commons/issues/124
is merged and released.

This also uses Metro (JAX-WS Reference Implementation) implicitly rather than relying on the presence of a JDK.
